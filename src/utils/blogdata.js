          <ol>

            <li><strong>Avoid Text:</strong> Since app icons are small, it's best to avoid including text. Instead, focus on using symbols or graphics that convey your app's purpose or theme.</li>
            <li><strong>Test Variations:</strong> Consider creating multiple versions of your app icon and testing them to see which one resonates best with your audience. A/B testing can help determine the most effective design.</li>
